<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><title>route</title></head><body>route is The URL used to direct requests to an application. A route is made up of an optional host (or subdomain) and a domain that
    are specified when an application is pushed. For example, in the route myapp.example.com, myapp is the host and example.com
    is the domain. A route can be associated with one or more applications. Unless a custom domain is specified, Bluemix
    uses a default shared domain in the route to your application.  </body></html>
