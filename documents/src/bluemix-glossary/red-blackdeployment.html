<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><title>red-black deployment</title></head><body>red-black deployment is A deployment technique that drives continuous delivery by enabling synchronized test, development, and deployment. Initially,
    development is done on an inactive environment (black) while the active environment continues to take traffic (red).
    Once deployment starts, both environments go live (red-red) until routing is disabled on the formerly active, previous
    version environment, then subsequently removed (black) while the new environment serves as the only active environment.
