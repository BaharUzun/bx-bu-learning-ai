<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><title>General Information</title></head><body>Exterior lamps have vents to accommodate normal changes in air pressure.<br><br>Condensation can be a natural by-product of this design. When moist air enters the lamp assembly through the vents, there is a possibility that condensation can occur when the temperature is cold. When normal condensation occurs, a fine mist can form on the interior of the lens. The fine mist eventually clears and exits through the vents during normal operation.<br><br>Clearing time may take as long as 48 hours under dry weather conditions.<br><br>If you see any unacceptable condensation, have your vehicle checked by an authorized dealer.<br><br></body></html>
