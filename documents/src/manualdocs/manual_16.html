<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><title>Principle of Operation</title></head><body>All seating positions in your vehicle have lap and shoulder safety belts. All occupants of the vehicle should always properly wear their safety belts, even when an airbag supplemental restraint system is provided.<br><br>The safety belt pretensioners at the front seating positions are designed to tighten the safety belts when activated. In frontal and near-frontal crashes, the safety belt pretensioners may be activated alone or, if the crash is of sufficient severity, together with the front airbags. The pretensioners may also activate when a side curtain airbag is deployed.<br><br></body></html>
