<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><title>Front Passenger Sensing System</title></head><body>This system works with sensors that are part of the front passenger seat and safety belt to detect the presence of a properly-seated occupant and determine if the front passenger frontal airbag should be enabled (may inflate) or not.<br><br>The front passenger sensing system uses a passenger airbag off indicator which will illuminate and stay lit to remind you that the front passenger frontal airbag is disabled.<br><br>The indicator lamp is located at the top center of the instrument panel.<br><br>The front passenger sensing system is designed to disable (will not inflate) the front passenger frontal airbag when a rear facing infant seat, a forward-facing child restraint, or a booster seat is detected. Even with this technology, parents are strongly encouraged to always properly restrain children in the rear seat. The sensor also turns off the passenger front airbag and seat-mounted side airbag when the passenger seat is empty.<br><br>The front passenger sensing system is designed to enable (may inflate) the front passenger frontal airbag anytime the system senses that a person of adult size is sitting properly in the front passenger seat.<br><br>After all occupants have adjusted their seats and put on safety belts, it is very important that they continue to sit properly. A properly seated occupant sits upright, leaning against the seatback, and centered on the seat cushion, with their feet comfortably extended on the floor. Sitting improperly can increase the chance of injury in a crash event. For example, if an occupant slouches, lies down, turns sideways, sits forward, leans forward or sideways, or puts one or both feet up, the chance of injury during a crash is greatly increased.<br><br>If you think that the status of the passenger airbag off indicator lamp is incorrect, check for the following:<br><br>The conditions listed above may cause the weight of a properly seated occupant to be incorrectly interpreted by the front passenger sensing system. The person in the front passenger seat may appear heavier or lighter due to the conditions described in the list above.<br><br>If the airbag readiness light is lit, do the following:<br><br>The driver and adult passengers should check for objects lodged underneath the front passenger seat, or cargo interfering with the seat.<br><br>If there are lodged objects, or cargo is interfering with the seat, take the following steps to remove the obstruction:<br><br>Do not attempt to repair or service the system. Take your vehicle immediately to an authorized dealer.<br><br>If it is necessary to modify an advanced front airbag system to accommodate a person with disabilities, contact the Ford Customer Relationship Center.
