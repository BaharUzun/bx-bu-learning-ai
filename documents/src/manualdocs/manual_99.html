This allows the climate control system to respond quickly. The equipment includes a heater element (installed in the engine block) and a wire harness. You can connect the system to a grounded 120-volt AC electrical source.<br><br>The engine block heater plug is located in a housing in the left fog lamp bezel. Open the hinged, circular door and make sure the receptacle terminals are clean and dry prior to use. Clean them with a dry cloth if necessary.<br><br>The heater uses 0.4 to 1.0 kilowatt-hours of energy per hour of use. The system does not have a thermostat. It will achieve maximum temperature after approximately three hours of operation. If you use the heater longer than three hours, this will not improve system performance and will use unnecessary electricity.<br><br></body></html>
