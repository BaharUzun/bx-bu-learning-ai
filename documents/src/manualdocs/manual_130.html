<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><title>Blind Spot Information System</title></head><body>The Blind Spot Information System is designed to aid you in detecting vehicles that may have entered the blind spot zone (A). The detection area is on both sides of your vehicle, extending rearward from the exterior mirrors to approximately 4  m beyond the bumper. The system is designed to alert you if certain vehicles enter the blind spot zone while driving.<br><br>The Blind Spot Information System turns on when you start the engine and you drive your vehicle forward above 8  km/h.<br><br>For automatic transmissions, the Blind Spot Information System remains on while the transmission is in drive (D). If shifted into reverse (R) or park (P) the Blind Spot Information System turns off. Once shifted back into drive (D), the Blind Spot Information System turns back on when you drive your vehicle above 8  km/h.<br><br>For manual transmissions, the Blind Spot Information System is on for all gears except the reverse (R).<br><br>The Blind Spot Information System illuminates an amber alert indicator in the outside mirror on the side of your vehicle the approaching vehicle is coming from. When the Blind Spot Information System is alerting on a vehicle and the corresponding turn signal is ON, the Blind Spot Information System alert indicator flashes as an increased warning level.<br><br>The alert indicator dims when the system detects nighttime darkness.<br><br>The system uses radar sensors that are located behind the bumper fascia on each side of your vehicle. Any dirt, mud and snow in front of the sensors and/or driving in heavy rain can cause system degradation. Also, other types of obstructions in front of the sensor can cause system degradation. This is referred to as a ‘blocked’ condition.<br><br>If the system detects a degraded performance condition, a message warning of a blocked sensor will appear in the information display. Also the BLIS alert indicators will remain ON and BLIS will no longer provide any vehicle warnings. You can clear the information display warning but the alert indicators will remain illuminated.<br><br>If the system senses a problem with the left or right sensor, the telltale will illuminate and a message will appear in the information display. See  Information Messages. <br><br>You can temporarily switch the Blind Spot Information System off in the information display. See General Information.  When the Blind Spot Information System switches off, you will not receive alerts and the information display shows a system off message. The telltale in the cluster also illuminates. When you switch the Blind Spot Information System on or off, the alert indicators flash twice.<br><br>You can also have the Blind Spot Information System switched off permanently at an authorized dealer. Once switched off permanently, the system can only be switched back on at an authorized dealer.<br><br></body></html>
