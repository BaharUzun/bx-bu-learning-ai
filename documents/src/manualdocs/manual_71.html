Registers the accumulated distance your vehicle has traveled.<br><br>The high voltage battery gauge provides Charge Fill (State of Charge), Charge Assist and Regen Active information.<br><br>The fill level, or State of Charge indicates the amount of energy stored in the high voltage battery as a percent of total energy capacity. The level will increase or decrease as the battery charges and discharges during normal operation.<br><br>The fill level indicates the amount of energy stored in the high voltage battery which is available for Plug-in Power Mode. A full fill represents the total amount of energy you can get from an external charge (plugging your vehicle in). When the fill reaches empty your vehicle will automatically enter Hybrid Mode.<br><br>The up and down arrows provide information about the energy going into and out of the high voltage battery. The up arrow above the battery indicates battery charging such as from regenerative braking. The down arrow below the battery indicates battery discharging to provide power for propulsion or vehicle accessories.<br><br>A circular arrow symbol appears in the center of the battery gauge when energy is being recaptured through the regenerative braking system.<br><br>You can switch this feature on or off in the information displays settings menu. See General Information. <br><br>Switch the ignition on. The fuel gauge will indicate approximately how much fuel is in the fuel tank. The arrow adjacent to the fuel pump symbol indicates on which side of your vehicle the fuel filler door is located.<br><br>The needle should move toward F when you refuel your vehicle. If the needle points to E after adding fuel, this indicates your vehicle needs service soon.<br><br>After refueling some variability in needle position is normal:<br><br>A low fuel reminder triggers when the distance to empty reaches about 50 miles (80 km) to empty.<br><br>See General Information. <br><br>See General Information. <br><br>See General Information. <br><br>The Brake Coach appears after the vehicle has come to a stop. It coaches you to brake in a manner which maximizes the amount of energy returned through the regenerative braking system. The percent displayed is an indication of the regenerative braking efficiency with 100% representing the maximum amount of energy recovery.<br><br>You can switch this feature on or off in the information displays settings menu. See General Information. <br><br>Trip Summary displays upon shutting off your vehicle. The information is cumulative over the last trip. A new trip begins each time your start your vehicle (when the Ready to Drive message comes on). Corresponding trip efficiency leaves appear on the right information display.<br><br>See General Information. <br><br>See General Information. <br><br>See General Information. <br><br>See General Information. <br><br>See General Information. <br><br>Vehicle range indicates the estimated distance your vehicle will travel with the energy currently onboard.<br><br>Changes in driving pattern and climate control use will cause the value to vary.<br><br>Trip Efficiency Leaves display upon shutting off your vehicle. The number of leaves represent the average for the last trip. A new trip begins each time you start your vehicle (when the Ready to Drive message comes on).
