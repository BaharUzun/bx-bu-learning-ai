Make sure that you fully engage the mirror in its support when returning it to its original position.<br><br>See  Heated Windows and Mirrors. <br><br>You can save and recall the mirror positions through the memory function. See  Memory Function. <br><br>The driver exterior mirror automatically dims when the interior auto-dimming mirror turns on.<br><br>The outer portion of the appropriate mirror housing will blink when you switch on the turn signal.<br><br>The lamps on the bottom part of the mirror housing light when you use your transmitter to unlock the doors or when you open a door.<br><br>Blind spot mirrors have an integrated convex mirror built into the upper outboard corner of the exterior mirrors. They can increase your visibility along the side of your vehicle.<br><br>Check the main mirror first before a lane change, then check the blind spot mirror. If the blind spot mirror does not show any vehicles in its viewing area and the traffic in the adjacent lane is at a safe distance, signal that you intend to change lanes. Glance over your shoulder to verify traffic is clear and carefully change lanes.<br><br>The image of the approaching vehicle is small and near the inboard edge of the main mirror when it is at a distance. The image becomes larger and begins to move outboard across the main mirror as the vehicle approaches (A). The image will transition from the main mirror and begin to appear in the blind spot mirror as the vehicle approaches (B). The vehicle will transition to your peripheral field of view as it leaves the blind spot mirror (C).<br><br>See  Blind Spot Information System. <br><br></body></html>
