<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><title>Using Adaptive Cruise Control</title></head><body> The system adjusts your vehicle speed to maintain the set gap between you and the vehicle in front of you in the same lane.  You can select four gap settings.<br><br>The adaptive cruise controls are on the steering wheel.<br><br>Energi vehicles: ECO Cruise can be turned on or off through the information display. See Information Displays. <br><br>Hybrid vehicles: ECO Cruise is included in EcoSelect which is turned on or off using the ECO button on the center console.<br><br>For additional information, refer to ECO Cruise and EcoSelect. See  Hybrid Electric Vehicle. <br><br>Press and release ON.<br><br>The current gap setting and set speed also appear in the information display.<br><br>When a vehicle ahead of you enters the same lane or a slower vehicle is ahead in the same lane, the vehicle speed adjusts to maintain a preset gap. The lead vehicle graphic illuminates.<br><br>When you are following a vehicle and you switch on your left-turn signal, adaptive cruise control may provide a small temporary acceleration to help you pass.<br><br>The vehicle applies brakes to slow the vehicle to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front. The maximum braking which the system can apply is limited. You can override the system by applying the brakes.<br><br>If the system predicts that its maximum braking level is insufficient, an audible warning sounds while the system continues to brake. The red warning bar appears on the windshield. You should take immediate action.<br><br>You can decrease or increase the distance between your vehicle and the vehicle in front by pressing the gap control.<br><br>The selected gap appears in the information display as shown by the bars in the graphic. Four gap distance settings are available.<br><br>Each time you start the vehicle, the system selects the last chosen gap setting.<br><br>You can override the set speed and gap distance by pressing the accelerator pedal.<br><br>The system will resume operation when you release the accelerator pedal. The vehicle speed will decrease to the set speed, or a lower speed if following a slower vehicle.<br><br>The system may apply the brakes to slow the vehicle to the new set speed. The set speed displays continuously in the information display when the system is active.<br><br>Press and release RES. The vehicle returns to the previously set speed. The set speed displays continuously in the information display while the system is active.<br><br>The system does not operate below 20  km/h. An audible warning sounds and the automatic braking releases if the vehicle drops below this speed.<br><br>You should select a lower gear position when the system is active in situations such as prolonged downhill driving on steep grades, for example in mountainous areas. The system needs additional engine braking in these situations to reduce the load on the vehicle’s regular brake system to prevent them from overheating.<br><br>Press and release OFF or switch off the ignition.<br><br>The radar sensor has a limited field of vision. It may not detect vehicles at all or may detect a vehicle later than expected in some situations. The lead vehicle graphic will not illuminate if the system does not detect a vehicle in front of you.<br><br>In these cases the system may brake late or unexpectedly. You should stay alert and intervene if necessary.<br><br>If something hits the front end of your vehicle or damage occurs, the radar-sensing zone may change. This could cause missed or false vehicle detections. Contact an authorized dealer to check the radar for proper coverage and operation.<br><br>A message appears if something obstructs the sensor's radar signals. The sensor is located behind a cover near the driver side of the lower grille. The system cannot detect a vehicle ahead and does not function when something obstructs the radar signal.<br><br>The following table lists possible causes and actions for this message displaying.<br><br>Due to the nature of radar technology, it is possible to get a blockage warning and not be blocked. This can happen, for example, when driving in sparse rural or desert environments. A false blocked condition will either self clear or clear after a key cycle.<br><br>You can manually change from adaptive cruise control to normal cruise control through the information display.See Information Displays. <br><br></body></html>
