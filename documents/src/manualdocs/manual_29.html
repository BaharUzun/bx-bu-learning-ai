<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><title>Crash Sensors and Airbag Indicator</title></head><body>Your vehicle has a collection of crash and occupant sensors which provide information to the restraints control module. The restraints control module deploys (activates) the front safety belt pretensioners, driver airbag, passenger airbag, knee airbag(s), seat mounted side airbags, side curtain airbags and optional rear inflatable safety belts. Based on the type of crash (frontal impact or side impact), the restraints control module will deploy the appropriate safety devices.<br><br>The restraints control module also monitors the readiness of the above safety devices plus the crash and occupant sensors. The readiness of the safety system is indicated by a warning indicator light in the instrument cluster or by a backup tone if the warning light is not working. Routine maintenance of the airbag is not required.<br><br>A difficulty with the system is indicated by one or more of the following:<br><br>If any of these things happen, even intermittently, have the supplemental restraint system serviced at an authorized dealer immediately. Unless serviced, the system may not function properly in the event of a crash.<br><br>The safety belt pretensioners and the front airbag supplemental restraint system are designed to activate when the vehicle sustains frontal deceleration sufficient to cause the restraints control module to deploy a safety device.<br><br></body></html>
