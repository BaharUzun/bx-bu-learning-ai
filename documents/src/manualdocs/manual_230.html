By using several important factors in its calculations, the monitor helps reduce the cost of owning your vehicle and reduces environmental waste at the same time.<br><br>This means you do not have to remember to change the oil on a mileage-based schedule. Your vehicle lets you know when an oil change is due by displaying a message in the information display.<br><br>The following table provides examples of vehicle use and its impact on oil change intervals. It is a guideline only. Actual oil change intervals depend on several factors and generally decrease with severity of use.<br><br>1 Do not exceed two years or 20000 miles (32000 kilometers) between service intervals.<br><br>2 Perform multi-point inspection (recommended).<br><br>3 Reset the Intelligent Oil-Life Monitor system anytime you change the engine oil and filter. See  Engine Oil Check. <br><br>1 Perform these maintenance items within 3000 miles (4800 kilometers) of the last engine oil and filter change. Do not exceed the designated distance for the interval.<br><br>2 Inspect the engine oil filter for corrosion every one year or 10000 miles (16000 kilometers). If corrosion is present, change the filter then top-off the engine oil, if required. Do not reset the Intelligent Oil-Life Monitor.<br><br>3 Initial replacement at six years or 100000 miles (160000 kilometers), then every three years or 50000 miles (80000 kilometers).<br><br></body></html>
