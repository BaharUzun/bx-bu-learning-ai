<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><title>Using Summer Tires</title></head><body>Summer tires provide superior performance on wet and dry roads. Summer tires do not have the Mud and Snow (M+S or M/S) tire traction rating on the tire side wall. Since summer tires do not have the same traction performance as All-season or Snow tires, we do not recommend using summer tires when temperatures drop to approximately 7 °C or below (depending on tire wear and environmental conditions) or in snow and ice conditions. Like any tire, summer tire performance is affected by tire wear and environmental conditions. If you must drive in those conditions, we recommend using Mud and Snow (M+S, M/S), All-season or Snow tires.<br><br>Always store your summer tires indoors at temperatures above 20ºF (-7ºC). The rubber compounds used in these tires lose flexibility and may develop surface cracks in the tread area at temperatures below 20ºF (-7ºC). If the tires have been subjected to 20ºF (-7ºC) or less, warm them in a heated space to at least 40ºF (5ºC) for at least 24 hours before installing them on a vehicle, or moving the vehicle with the tires installed, or checking tire inflation. Do not place tires near heaters or heating devices used to warm the room where the tires are stored. Do not apply heat or blow heated air directly on the tires. Always inspect the tires after storage periods and before use.<br><br></body></html>
