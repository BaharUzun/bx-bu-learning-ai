<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><title>Seatbelt Reminder</title></head><body>This feature supplements the safety belt warning function by providing additional reminders that intermittently sound a tone and illuminate the safety belt warning light when you are in the driver seat or you have a front seat passenger and a safety belt is unbuckled.<br><br>The system uses information from the front passenger sensing system to determine if a front seat passenger is present and therefore potentially in need of a warning. To avoid the system turning on the Belt-Minder feature for objects you place on the front passenger seat, only the front seat passengers receive warnings as determined by the front passenger sensing system.<br><br>If the Belt-Minder warnings expire (warnings for about five minutes) for one passenger (driver or front passenger), the other passenger can still cause the Belt-Minder feature to turn on.<br><br>Read Steps 1â€“4 thoroughly before proceeding with the programming procedure.<br><br></body></html>
