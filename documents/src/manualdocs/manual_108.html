All of the high-voltage power flows through specific wiring assemblies labeled as such or covered with a solid orange convolute, or orange striped tape, or both. Do not come in contact with these components.<br><br>The high-voltage battery system is a high-voltage, lithium-ion battery system. The pack is located in the rear cargo area. The high-voltage battery system uses an air-cooled system to regulate the high-voltage battery temperature and help maximize high-voltage battery life.<br><br>The high-voltage service disconnect turns off power from the high-voltage battery.<br><br>To disable the battery and stop all high-voltage electric activity in the vehicle you can access the high-voltage disconnect circuit. To do this, you must unplug the circuit from the circuit port connected to the battery.<br><br>The high-voltage service disconnect is located behind the rear fold down seats.<br><br></body></html>
