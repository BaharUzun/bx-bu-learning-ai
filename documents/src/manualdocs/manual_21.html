However, if the crash was minor and an authorized dealer finds that the belts do not show damage and continue to operate properly, they do not need to be replaced. Safety belt assemblies not in use during a crash should also be inspected and replaced if either damage or improper operation is noted.<br><br>Properly care for safety belts.
