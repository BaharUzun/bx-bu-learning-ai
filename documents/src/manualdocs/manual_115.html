<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><title>Hill Start Assist</title></head><body>The system makes it easier to pull away when your vehicle is on a slope without the need to use the parking brake.<br><br>When the system is active, your vehicle remains stationary on the slope for two to three seconds after you release the brake pedal. This allows time to move your foot from the brake to the accelerator pedal. The system releases the brakes automatically once the engine has developed sufficient drive to prevent your vehicle from rolling down the slope. This is an advantage when pulling away on a slope, for example from a car park ramp, traffic lights or when reversing uphill into a parking space.<br><br>You can switch this feature on or off in the information display. The system remembers the last setting when you start your vehicle.<br><br>You cannot turn the system on or off. When you switch the ignition on, the system automatically turns on.<br><br></body></html>
