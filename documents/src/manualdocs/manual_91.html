As well as being programmed for garage doors, the system transmitter can be programmed to operate entry gate operators, security systems, entry door locks and home or office lighting.<br><br>Additional system information can be found online at www.homelink.com, www.youtube.com/HomeLinkGentex or by calling the toll-free help line on 1-800-355-3515.<br><br>This process is to program your hand-held transmitter and your in-vehicle HomeLink button.<br><br>If the indicator light stays on, the programming is complete. No further action is needed.<br><br>If the indicator light flashes rapidly for 2 seconds and then turns to a constant light, the HomeLink button is not programmed yet. See Programming Your Garage Door Opener Motor.<br><br>To program additional buttons, repeat Steps 1 – 4.<br><br>For questions or comments, please contact HomeLink at www.homelink.com, www.youtube.com/HomeLinkGentex or 1-800-355-3515.<br><br>Canadian radio-frequency laws require transmitter signals to “time-out” (or quit) after several seconds of transmission – which may not be long enough for HomeLink to pick up the signal during programming. Similar to this Canadian law, some U.S. gate operators are designed to “time-out” in the same manner.<br><br>To program a device to a previously trained button, follow these steps:<br><br>For questions or comments, contact HomeLink at www.homelink.com, www.youtube.com/HomeLinkGentex or 1-800-355-3515.<br><br>Once HomeLink has been programmed successfully, the Genie transmitter must be changed out of program mode. To do this:<br><br>Programming is now complete.<br><br>To erase programming from the three HomeLink buttons press and hold the two outer HomeLink buttons until the indicator light begins to flash. The indicator light will begin flashing in 10 to 20 seconds, at which time both buttons should be released. Programming has now been erased, and the indicator light should blink slowly to indicate the device is in train mode when any of the three HomeLink buttons are pressed.<br><br>This device complies with Part 15 of the FCC Rules and with RSS-210 of Industry Canada.
