<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><title>Cross Traffic Alert</title></head><body>Cross Traffic Alert is designed to warn you of vehicles approaching from the sides when the transmission is in reverse (R).<br><br>Cross Traffic Alert turns on when you start the engine and you shift into reverse (R). Once shifted out of reverse (R), Cross Traffic Alert turns off.<br><br>Cross Traffic Alert is designed to detect vehicles that approach with a speed up to 60  km/h. Coverage decreases when the sensors are partially, mostly or fully obstructed. Reversing slowly helps increase the coverage area and effectiveness.<br><br>In this first example, the left sensor is only partially obstructed; zone coverage to the right is nearly maximized.<br><br>Zone coverage also decreases when parking at shallow angles. Here, the left sensor is mostly obstructed; zone coverage on that side is severely limited.<br><br>The Cross Traffic Alert illuminates an amber alert indicator in the outside mirror on the side of your vehicle the approaching vehicle is coming from. Cross Traffic Alert also sounds an audible alert and a message appears in the information display indicating a vehicle is coming from the right or left. Cross Traffic Alert works with the reverse sensing system that sounds its own series of tones. See  Rear Parking Aid. <br><br>The system uses radar sensors that are located behind the bumper fascia on each side of your vehicle. Do not allow mud, snow or bumper stickers to obstruct these areas, this can cause degraded system performance. See  Blind Spot Information System.  If the Blind Spot Information System is blocked, Cross Traffic Alert is also blocked. A corresponding message appears in the information display as soon as you shift the transmission into reverse (R).<br><br>Cross Traffic Alert has its limitations; situations such as severe weather conditions or debris build-up on the sensor area may limit vehicle detection.<br><br>There may be certain instances when there is a false alert by the Cross Traffic Alert system that illuminates the alert indicator with no vehicle in the coverage zone. Some amount of false alerts are normal; they are temporary and self-correct.<br><br>If Cross Traffic Alert senses a problem with the left or right sensor a message will appear in the information display. See  General Information. <br><br>You can temporarily switch Cross Traffic Alert off in the information display. See  General Information.  When you switch Cross Traffic Alert off, you will not receive alerts and the information display will display a system off message.<br><br>You can also have Cross Traffic Alert switched off permanently at an authorized dealer. Once switched off permanently, the system can only be switched back on at an authorized dealer.<br><br></body></html>
