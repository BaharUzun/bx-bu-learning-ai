<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><title>Using Voice Recognition</title></head><body>This system helps you control many features using voice commands. This allows you to keep your hands on the wheel and focus on what is in front of you.<br><br>You can say any of the voice commands that appear within open and close brackets that are separated by |. For example, where (cancel | stop | exit) appears you say; cancel or stop or exit.<br><br>You must say any of the voice commands that appear outside of open and close brackets. For example, where mobile (apps | applications) appears, you must say mobile followed by either apps or applications.<br><br>You do not need to say words that appear within square brackets. For example, for where (USB [stick] | iPOD | MP3 [player]) appears, you can say USB or USB stick.<br><br>The system provides feedback through audible tones, prompts, questions and spoken confirmations depending on the situation and the chosen level of interaction (voice settings). You can customize the voice recognition system to provide more or less instruction and feedback.<br><br>The default setting is to a higher level of interaction in order to help you learn to use the system. You can change these settings at any time.<br><br>The system defaults to the standard interaction mode.<br><br>Confirmation prompts are short questions the system asks when it is not sure of your request or when there are multiple possible responses to your request. For example, the system may ask "Phone, is that correct?". If turned off, the system simply makes a best guess as to what you requested and may ask you to confirm settings.<br><br>The system creates candidate lists when it has the same confidence level of several options based on your voice command. When turned on, it may prompt you with as many as four possibilities for clarification.<br><br>For example, say "Say 1 after the tone to call John Doe at home. Say 2 after the tone to call Johnny Doe on mobile. Say 3 after the tone to call Jane Doe at home." You could also say "Say 1 after the tone to play John Doe, Say 2 after the tone to play Johnny Doe."<br><br></body></html>
