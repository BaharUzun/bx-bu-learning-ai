<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><title>Pre-Collision Assist</title></head><body>The system alerts you of certain collision risks. The system's sensor detects your vehicle's rapid approach to other vehicles traveling in the same direction as your vehicle.<br><br>When your vehicle rapidly approaches another vehicle, a red warning light flashes and a tone sounds.<br><br>The brake support system assists you in reducing any collision speed by pre-charging the brakes. If the risk of collision continues to increases after the audio-visual warning, the brake support prepares the brake system for rapid braking. The system does not automatically activate the brakes, but if the brake pedal is pressed even lightly, the brakes apply full stopping power.<br><br>You can adjust the warning system's sensitivity through your information display. See  General Information. <br><br>If a blocked sensor message appears in the information display, dirt, water, or an object is blocking the sensor. The sensor is located behind a cover near the driver side of the lower grille. If anything blocks the sensor, your vehicle cannot see through the sensor, and the pre-collision assist system will not work. Possible causes for the blocked sensor message and corrective actions are listed below.<br><br>Due to the nature of radar technology, there may be certain instances where vehicles do not provide a collision warning. These include:<br><br>Damage to the front end of your vehicle may alter the radar sensor's coverage area. This may result in missed or false collision warnings. Have an authorized dealer check your radar sensor for proper coverage and operation.<br><br></body></html>
