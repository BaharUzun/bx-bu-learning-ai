<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><title>Active Park Assist</title></head><body>The system detects an available parallel parking space and automatically steers your vehicle into the space (hands-free) while you control the accelerator, gearshift and brakes. The system visually and audibly instructs you to park your vehicle.<br><br>The system may not function correctly if something passes between the front bumper and the parking space (a pedestrian or cyclist) or if the edge of the neighboring parked vehicle is high off the ground (for example, a bus, tow truck or flatbed truck).<br><br>The touchscreen displays a message and a corresponding graphic to indicate it is searching for a parking space. Use the direction indicator to indicate which side of your vehicle you want the system to search.<br><br>When the system finds a suitable space, the touchscreen displays a message and a tone sounds. Slow down, continue moving forward and stop when another tone sounds and a message displays on the touchscreen (at approximately position A), then follow the instructions on the touchscreen.<br><br>When you shift the transmission into reverse (R), with your hands off the wheel (and nothing obstructing its movement), your vehicle steers itself into the space. Indicated by tones, instructions to move your vehicle back and forth in the space, display on the touchscreen.<br><br>When you think your vehicle has enough space in front and behind it, or you hear a solid tone from the parking aid (accompanied by a touchscreen display message and a chime), bring your vehicle to a complete stop.<br><br>When automatic steering is finished, the touch screen displays a message and a tone sounds, indicating that the active park assist process is done. The driver is responsible for checking the parking job and making any necessary corrections before putting the transmission in park (P).<br><br>If a problem occurs with the system, a warning message is displayed, followed by a tone. Occasional system messages may occur in normal operation. For recurring or frequent system faults, contact an authorized dealer to have your vehicle serviced.<br><br></body></html>
